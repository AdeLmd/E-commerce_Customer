#INTRODUCTION:

The evolution of e-commerce has revolutionized the way businesses engage with customers. In this digital landscape, understanding customer behavior becomes pivotal for sustained success.

The dataset encapsulates a myriad of customer-centric attributes, including demographic details, purchase behaviors, satisfaction indicators, and geographical insights. Each entry offers a glimpse into customers' diverse interactions while navigating the e-commerce platform.

#OBJECTIVE:

The primary objective is to unravel the intricate nuances of customer behavior, seeking insights that empower businesses to make informed decisions. By dissecting various facets of this dataset, we aim to extract valuable patterns and correlations to enhance the overall customer experience.

#METHODOLOGY:

My methodology encompasses a multifaceted analysis, diving into customer segmentation, satisfaction assessment, promotion strategies, retention tactics, and geographical insights. By employing a data-driven approach, I aim to unlock actionable insights that can drive meaningful business decisions.

#DATA PREPARATION AND CLEANING

I chose to use SQL for my data cleaning and exploration process and after importing the CSV file into MySQL, I named the table "customer" to make it easier to work with in my analysis.

After a thorough review, I discovered that two roles had empty spaces in the Satisfaction Level column due to a lack of customer feedback. To enhance clarity, these empty spaces were replaced with 'N/A' (Not Applicable). 

#STATISTICS ANALYSIS:

The analysis of customer behavior within the e-commerce realm is not merely an exercise in understanding preferences; it's a strategic imperative. It allows businesses to craft personalized experiences, refine marketing strategies, optimize retention efforts, and, ultimately, foster long-term relationships with customers.
